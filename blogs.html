                    <p class="blog-date">Posted on: August 19, 2025</p>
                    <p>Sooooo! It's been awhile since I made some news with the blog post system I spent time working on 😭. It's okay. Into the news part however! I finally launched my latest app AllerScan. A new tool designed to make managing food allergies easier than ever. Whether you’re grocery shopping, dining out, or looking after someone with severe allergies, AllerScan helps you identify allergens instantly. Just point your phone at a food barcode and get clear results.</p>
                    <p>The app is currently out on the Apple App Store (you can download it <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/allerscan-allergy-scanning/id6749399216" target="_blank">here</a>) with the Google Play Store release coming in the next few weeks due to Google’s review process.</p>

                    <p class="blog-date">Posted on: September 15, 2024</p>
                    <p>After doing some more practice with HTML and CSS, I finally did a full rewrite of my website. And it looks so much better. I realized the old design was a bit too eye-straining, so I made some changes to the background colors.</p>

                    <p class="blog-date">Posted on: December 19, 2023</p>
                    <p>I know I just released an update. However, I just updated Gimer Server Tools to 1.8. This is because I just added Folia support to my Plugin. Well in Beta at least more to come soon. I will probably get more work done on the website. Possibly make a newsletter. I also got a lot of work done on my new plugin today so that is good.</p>

                    <p>Version 1.7 of Gimer Server Tools has released with a ChatLogs feature. I'm sorry for the long wait. I have now started work on new plugins. I will release more updates about these plugins once I get to a point where I feel they are ready to be revealed.</p>
