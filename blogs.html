                    <p>After doing some more practice with HTML and CSS, I finally did a full rewrite of my website. And it looks so much better. I realized the old design was a bit too eye-straining, so I made some changes to the background colors.</p>

                    <p class="blog-date">Posted on: December 19, 2023</p>
                    <p>I know I just released an update. However, I just updated Gimer Server Tools to 1.8. This is because I just added Folia support to my Plugin. Well in Beta at least more to come soon. I will probably get more work done on the website. Possibly make a newsletter. I also got a lot of work done on my new plugin today so that is good.</p>

                    <p>Version 1.7 of Gimer Server Tools has released with a ChatLogs feature. I'm sorry for the long wait. I have now started work on new plugins. I will release more updates about these plugins once I get to a point where I feel they are ready to be revealed.</p>
